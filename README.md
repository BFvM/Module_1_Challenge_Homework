# GOJEK


## Overview and Origin

Traffic congestion is a fact of life for most Indonesian residents. The nation’s roads and associated infrastructure strains to support the country’s 260 million people, about 30 million of whom reside in greater Jakarta. To negotiate traffic, Indonesians rely heavily on motorcycles, including motorcycle taxis, known as ojeks, to travel to and from work or personal engagements.

Co-founded by Nadiem Makarim and Michaelangelo Moran in 2009, and incorporated in 2010, PT Gojek Indonesia or Gojek is an Indonesian based on-demand multi-service platform and digital payment technology group based in Jakarta that began as a ride-hail service. 

Gojek began with only 20 motorbike drivers and a ‘manual’ booking system.  Today, in little over a decade the company has evolved and rapidly expanded across south-east Asia. Their recent merger with Tokopedia saw the establishment of a new holding GoTo (May 2021), that is an e-commerce, financial and on-demand super app offering a suite of financial and over 20 on-demand services that include the original ride share business now supported by over 2M drivers, as well as shopping and food delivery with more than 1M merchant partners.

Valued at $10B USD today, Gojek has raised $5.3B in funding over 13 rounds from over 35 investors, including Astra International, Blibi, Mitsubishi, KKR, Google, Facebook, PayPal, JD.com Visa and Tencent among others. A massive advance from Gojek’s first funding round in late 2014 with NSI Ventures followed soon after by Sequoia India and Northstar’s private equity fund.


## Business Activities

Gojek began as a ride-share service and rapidly evolved to a tech solution company.  Early in it’s development Gojek’s purpose became clear as it quickly recognised it’s value lay in removing fiction in people’s lives by using technology to connect consumers to the best providers of goods and services in each market it operates in. And, supporting this through a super app platform for drivers, consumers and merchants with payment and others services that makes it easy for service providers and users to transact across.

Most importantly Gojek leverages it’s local understanding of social, economic and cultural opportunities across South-East Asia (SEA).

In transport it out competes brands like Uber and Lyft:

Scooter and motorbike transport is more efficient in SEA’s crowded and congested urban centres
The running cost of scooters and motorbikes are a faction of that of cars
Digital mapping partnership with Google Maps gives drivers traffic route solutions that include laneways and paths that cars cannot access
Development of a food and shopping solution that gives drivers additional income
On-demand mechanical service Go-Auto ensures its fleet of vehicles maximise time on-the-road

Importantly Gojek leverages cultural and economic understanding by building verticals that feed into existing business. GoToko is a B2B platform that connects micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMES) through a partnership with Unilever and other leading consumer goods companies to purchase and deliver products and brands at competitive and affordable prices. This ensures merchant profitability, and supports culturally important businesses, like warungs (local family run restaurants in people’s homes), so they are affordable and can continue to support the micro economy of their community. Technology is at the heart (or rather the brain), of Gojek and GoTo. In 2016 Gojek acquired C42 Engineering and DodeIgnition, two Bangalore startups, and later Leftshift a mobile app developer and Pianta a healthcare both Indian startups. The next year, 2017, they aquired Lorket.com an online booking and event management system, and three Indonesian fintech firms; Kartuku, Midtrans and Mapan to push out their payments expertise.

Gojek and GoTo’s applications are supported by data technologies that amongst others include: SPF, IPv6, React, Java, Ruby, Golang, Clojure, InfluxDB.  Whilst their DevOps lists GitLab, Kubernetes, Vim, Grafana, Varnish, HAP{roxy, Google Kubernete and Kong.


## Landscape

Gojek (GoTo), is a super app that includes an on-demand multi-service platform with e-commerce and financial services that interfaces with drivers, merchants and consumers. Its payment services remain at the of its core function and associated activities.

In the last decade several trends have helped Gojek:

The radpid penetration, growth, reliability and affordability of mobile phones in SEA
The acceptance and use of online payments in place of cash – vitally important in a country where the banking system is under-developed
Improved data security of online payments ensuring consumer, driver and merchant acceptance in a nation where fraud has been endemic
Increasingly moving to ‘just-in-time’ processes within society solved by mobile technology and highly flexible transport solutions

Additionally, technological advances has allowed the development of super apps that enable consumers, merchants and transport providers to do everything they need within an eco-system. Super apps like GoTo provide:

Inclusivity via a well-designed interface and easy user experience
Data security through face recognition and digital identity affirmation
Fluidity of services within the platform reducing barriers to use
Convenience of not needing to operate several apps to achieve an outcome
Access a wider range of services

And for Goto the creation of a super app helped to streamline and scale it’s business operation whilst at  the same time creating a more powerful online presence.

Meantime Gojek was competing for ride-sahre business with Grab, Lyft and Uber. As mentioned earlier, Gojek’s single focus on two-wheel transport and creating a strong local identity helped it out perform Lyft and Uber leaving the competition with these brands to Grab.

Grab’s strategy to ‘get-ahead’ of Uber by launching early and aggressively in the emerging markets of Malaysia, Singapore and SEA required Grab spend, and spend big on recruitment, incentives and consumer promotions. Meanwhile, Gojek continued to focus on creating a super app like Alipay and WeChat, but one that solved difficult problems for the local Indonesian community.  Consequently, Gojek’s e-wallet service grew to 30% of all transactions in Indonesia in 2017  competiting with the country’s largest lenders; Bank Mandiri, Bank Central Asia and Telkomsel.


## Results

Before the global pandemic Gojek contributed 7.1B or 1.6% of GDP to the Indonesian economy. It’s app has been downloaded over 221M times, it has over 2M driver and 1M merchant partners.

It has become a dominant commerce platform across Indonesia and launched as a publicly traded company with an estimated value of over 10B USD with funding debt of just over $5B USD. This, compared to its closest rival Grab based in Singapore, which debuted on the Nasdaq stock market at $13.06 USD, and closed the 45% down the same day at $7.22 USD per share.

And, whilst the satisfaction of Gojek’s drivers is critical, studies report that the average income of full-time Gojek drivers is 1.25x higher than the average minimum wage in Indonesia.

So, as GoTo continues to evolve, it remains focussed on deeply understanding the culture and pain points of the markets it operates in, as it takes it users, merchants, drivers and partners on a journey to ‘remove friction from people’s lives’.


## Recommendations

It is estimated that almost 45% of Indonesia’s population are unbanked.

GoTo’s experience in payment management and its creation of GoPay is an opportunity for the business to further extend into banking services, consolidate and bond its user base to the brand, as well as attract Indonesia’s vast unbanked population.

The divide between rural and urban society across SEA is a cause for concern, particularly as rural communities are in danger of being left behind in the rapidly evolving digital ecosystem. Whilst mobile phone penetration has grown in rural communities, people in these communities have less opportunities, nor do they have the ability to take up e-commerce because services such as ride-share, food delivery and purchasing do not have the same focus as urban communities.

By offering financial services as a Trojan Horse, GoTo could spearhead the brand in these communities. There would be challenges of changing habits and behaviours associated with traditional currency (which can be stored in a jar under the bed) to e-wallets and online banking. Staying true to the brand’s philosophy of ‘removing friction’ might provide an entry if a meaningful point of friction can be identified.
